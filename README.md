# Bittorrent Go

Building a bittorent client with Go (v1.19) step by step, following the [instructions on codecrafters.io](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/bittorrent/overview).

In this project, we build a BitTorrent client that's capable of parsing a
.torrent file and downloading a file from a peer. Along the way, we learn
about how torrent files are structured, HTTP trackers, BitTorrentâ€™s Peer
Protocol, pipelining and more.
